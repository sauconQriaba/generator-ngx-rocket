Non-conventional energy sources are those that are renewable, sustainable and environmentally friendly. They include solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydro, tidal, wave and ocean thermal energy. These sources of energy have the potential to meet the growing demand of heat and electricity in the world, especially in developing countries like India.

One of the best textbooks that covers the topic of non-conventional energy sources is *Non-Conventional Energy Sources* by G.D. Rai. This book was first published in 1979 and has been revised and updated several times since then. The latest edition is the sixth one, which was published in 2017 by Khanna Publishers.
 
The book is divided into 14 chapters, each covering a different aspect of non-conventional energy sources. The chapters are as follows:
 
1. Introduction
2. Solar Radiation
3. Solar Thermal Systems
4. Solar Photovoltaic Systems
5. Wind Energy
6. Biomass Energy
7. Biogas
8. Geothermal Energy
9. Magneto Hydro Dynamics (MHD)
10. Fuel Cells
11. Tidal Energy
12. Wave Energy
13. Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC)
14. Hydrogen Energy

The book is written in a simple and lucid language, with clear diagrams, tables and examples. It also contains numerous solved and unsolved problems, multiple choice questions and review questions at the end of each chapter. The book is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate students of engineering, as well as professionals and researchers in the field of renewable energy.
 
The book is available for free download from various online sources, such as Google Books[^1^] and Scribd[^2^]. However, readers are advised to respect the copyright of the author and the publisher and use the book for educational purposes only.
  
Non-conventional energy sources have many advantages over conventional sources of energy, such as fossil fuels and nuclear power. Some of these advantages are:

- They are renewable and inexhaustible, meaning they will not run out or deplete over time. They can be replenished by natural processes, such as sunlight, wind, water and biomass.
- They are eco-friendly and cause less pollution and greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels and nuclear power. They do not contribute to global warming, acid rain, smog or radioactive waste.
- They are less expensive and more accessible than conventional sources of energy. They do not require costly extraction, transportation or refining processes. They can be used in remote and rural areas where grid electricity is not available or reliable.
- They are scalable and flexible, meaning they can be adapted to different sizes and locations according to the energy demand and availability. They can be integrated with existing energy systems or used as standalone systems.

However, non-conventional energy sources also have some disadvantages and challenges that need to be overcome. Some of these are:

- They are intermittent and variable, meaning they depend on natural factors such as weather, season and time of day. They may not be available or sufficient when needed. They require backup systems or storage devices to ensure a continuous supply of energy.
- They have low energy density and efficiency, meaning they require large areas of land or water to capture and convert them into usable energy. They may also have high initial costs of installation and maintenance.
- They face technical and social barriers, such as lack of infrastructure, expertise, awareness and acceptance. They may also face legal, regulatory and policy issues that hinder their development and deployment.

Therefore, non-conventional energy sources need to be developed and utilized in a sustainable and optimal manner, taking into account their benefits and drawbacks. They need to be supported by appropriate technologies, policies and incentives that encourage their adoption and integration with conventional sources of energy. They also need to be complemented by energy conservation and efficiency measures that reduce the overall energy demand and consumption.
